# BCC-Security-Vulnerability
## THIS POST IS MADE FOR EDUCATION PURPOSES AND SPREADING AWARENESS PLS DON'T PUNISH ME BCC TEACHER !!11!

#### Ha Ha Funny Developers Exploit and a huge amount of trolling


## 1) Default Password Vulnerability

##### Most of the developers should know about this vulnerability because this is basic stuff, But sadly our teachers doesn't know about this `Basic` stuff

### How does this Vulnerability work?
#### (Blatant paste from Google lol) Well A Default Credential vulnerability is a type of vulnerability in a computing device that most commonly affects devices having some pre-set (default) administrative credentials to access all configuration settings.

### OMG VERY SCARY EXPLOIT  HOW DO I FIX !!!11!
#### Well this is pretty easy to fix, just change your password or if you don't know how to reset your password (which is pretty fucking stupid) just google it bro it's not that hard

### For BCC Developers
#### Just remember this I know about this exploit 3 sec after ur system got released lmafo kids are not stupid. And for "How to fix" here is my idea
#### Use the last 4 ID Card numbers after the default password `defaultpassword+last4ID` if the students are stupid enough to give away their ID Card info it's not your fault or just use random string idk just make the password unique.
