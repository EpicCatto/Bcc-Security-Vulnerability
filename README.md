##### Most of the developers should know about this vulnerability because this is basic stuff, But sadly our teachers doesn't know about this `Basic` stuff

### How does this Vulnerability work?
#### (Blatant paste from Google lol) Well A Default Credential vulnerability is a type of vulnerability in a computing device that most commonly affects devices having some pre-set (default) administrative credentials to access all configuration settings.

### OMG VERY SCARY EXPLOIT  HOW DO I FIX !!!11!
#### Well this is pretty easy to fix, just change your password or if you don't know how to reset your password (which is pretty fucking stupid) just google it bro it's not that hard

### For BCC Developers
#### Just remember this I know about this exploit 3 sec after ur system got released lmafo kids are not stupid. And for "How to fix" here is my idea
#### Use the last 4 ID Card numbers after the default password `defaultpassword+last4ID` if the students are stupid enough to give away their ID Card info it's not your fault or just use random string idk just make the password unique.

#### go read Vulnerability no.1 if you are still confused 

## 2) Student Image Database
#### I don't know if this is intentional or not, but It's going to be here anyway
#### as I'm a bcc student I'm very uncomfortable that everyone can see my face or make fun of me being "Very Fat" at that time and I think this database should be private I even made tools for this [BCC Student Searcher V1](https://github.com/EpicCatto/BCC-Student-Searcher) and [BCC Student Searcher V2](https://bccstudentsearcherv2.notthatuwu.xyz/searchengine).

### How does this Vulnerability work?
#### so basically the image database is public I'm not going to post the link here just in case
